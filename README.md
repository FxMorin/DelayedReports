# DelayedReports
### A mod that delays your chat messages so that they are delayed in reports. Making it harder for Mojang to validate, and hopefully a temporary solution to Fabricated chat reports

This mod does not visually change anything about chat messages. All chat messages will act normally, although internally the timestamp will be 4.5 minutes behind.  
This means your messages will most likely be seen as invalid or unusable by instigators who are reviewing your reports.  

**Example:**
